By passing parameters with the emitted events 

parameter is recieved as $event value of parameter binding 

We are emitting custom event to the parent 

$event == gets hold of any passed in parameter, and call the method which we wish to execute 

child component emits an event and all the logic is handled by parent component 

$event is reflected as index: number param sent using the EventEmitter from the FanItemComponent class 

Why is $event a number? Because we defined the type of the response when we create  fanRemoved event (fanRemoved: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter();)
